<h1>wave dash</h1>
<p class="p-1">A wave dash is basically a flip that you cancel whilst still maintaining the speed increase that you would have otherwise received. This is useful because a flip consumes quite a bit more time, and you cannot control yourself during the animation. Thus, jump, pull your nose up a little, let your car land on your back two wheels, push the stick forward, then jump again. Practice when stationary a bunch, before you try it. </p>
<h2>Best Party For Raiden Shogun</h2>
<p class="p-2">Raiden can provide stable Energy with her Elemental Burst and consistent Electro Status with her skill making her an amazing support for characters that deals powerful Burst Damage like Eula.</p>
<h3>Should You Pull For Kazuha ?</h3>
<p class="p-3">Kazuha has a crowd control ability that can gather nearby enemies. He can increase the elemental DMG of the element absorbed when triggering swirl reaction. With Viridescent Venerer, he can decrease the enemies' elemental resistance; he is a must-have character. Kazuha is already great initially and his constellations make him even better but it depends on your prioritization</p>
